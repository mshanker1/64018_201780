```{r}
library(lpSolveAPI)
x <- read.lp("dewright.lp")
x
solve(x)
get.objective(x)
get.constraints(x)
get.variables(x)
```

Now, let us consider preemptive goal programming with sequential approach
```{r}
y <- read.lp("dewright_1.lp")
y
solve(y)
get.objective(y)
get.constraints(y)
get.variables(y)
get.basis(y)
```

As there are multiple optimal solutions, we use the goals from stage 1 as constraints. Note that y2p and y3p are zero.
```{r}
z <- read.lp("dewright_2.lp")
z
solve(z)
get.objective(z)
get.constraints(z)
get.variables(z)
```

Alternativel, we can do the above two steps with one LP by using the big M method. Change the penalty for the first goals to be large.
```{r}
k <- read.lp("dewright_3.lp")
k
solve(k)
get.objective(k)
get.constraints(k)
get.variables(k)
```
